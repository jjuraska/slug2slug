"give_opinion(name[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings], rating[good], genres[real-time strategy], player_perspective[bird view])","Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a solid RTS. It takes a lot of what makes the genre good, like the bird view, and improves upon it."
"give_opinion(name[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings], rating[good], genres[real-time strategy], player_perspective[bird view])",I like bird's eye view real-time strategy games. Just like Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a good game.
"give_opinion(name[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings], rating[good], genres[real-time strategy], player_perspective[bird view])","I'm a fan of Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings because I've always liked real-time strategy games, and it's a pretty good one. The bird view perspective gives me a good overview of the game experience as I play."
"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], genres[action-adventure, role-playing, shooter], player_perspective[first person])","BioShock was pretty good, I think. It's a fairly unique first person shooter that crosses with role-playing as well as action-adventure and makes something new."
"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], genres[action-adventure, role-playing, shooter], player_perspective[first person])",I enjoyed playing BioShock a fair amount. I tend to enjoy first person shooters that also combine action-adventure and role-playing elements together like this one did.
"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], genres[action-adventure, role-playing, shooter], player_perspective[first person])","I'm generally a fan of first person action-adventure shooters that also add role-playing elements, so I thought BioShock was pretty good."
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], platforms[PC])",I really hate Bus Driver. SCS Software is a terrible developer and they're absolutely incompetent at making PC games.
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], platforms[PC])","Bus Driver was a rare miss for SCS Software. But, that PC game really stunk."
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], platforms[PC])","In my opinion, Bus Driver is an abomination of a game. I normally dislike PC games anyways, but to make things even worse, Bus Driver is developed by a terrible company, SCS Software."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], release_year[2014], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is okay, I guess. I normally like games with a first person perspective, but 2014 was just not a good year for game releases."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], release_year[2014], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","I was pretty unimpressed with 2014's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, just another generic first person title really."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], release_year[2014], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","For a 2014 game, I think Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare wasn't so fun to play from the first person perspective."
"give_opinion(name[Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[PC])",I had fun with Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines on the PC. The multiplayer especially was quite a blast.
"give_opinion(name[Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[PC])",I liked Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines because you can play it on PC and it has multiplayer support.
"give_opinion(name[Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[PC])",I think that Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is kind of fun. It's nice to have a game on the PC that I can play with my friends in multiplayer.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, sport])",I think Dirt: Showdown is pretty run-of-the-mill. The need to grab an E 10+ content rating took the life out of this sport racing game in my opinion.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, sport])","I sort of enjoyed the sport racing game, Dirt: Showdown. But the E 10+ game was just pretty average."
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, sport])","I thought Dirt: Showdown was an OK game. It's cool that I can play a sport racing game with my kids though, since it's rated E 10+."
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], release_year[2012], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average])","Dirt: Showdown isn't terrible, but I didn't particularly like it either. The E 10+ rating just means the content is too tame for my taste, but I have some fondness for games released in 2012 like this one."
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], release_year[2012], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average])","2012's Dirt: Showdown is an all-around average E 10+ rated game, I would say."
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], release_year[2012], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average])","I found Dirt: Showdown to be just so-so. Not only was it rated E 10+, making it bland,  but was released way back in the stone age of 2012."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], rating[poor], genres[music], player_perspective[first person])","Let me say this, I like music games, and I like the first person perspective too. So when I say Guitar Hero: Smash Hits is totally underwhelming, you know that's a hard thing to say."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], rating[poor], genres[music], player_perspective[first person])","I like first person games normally, but not even that could make a music game fun for me. In fact in Guitar Hero: Smash Hits, I think the perspective somehow made an already bad game even worse."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], rating[poor], genres[music], player_perspective[first person])","Guitar Hero: Smash Hits was certainly the very opposite of a smash hit with me. The music genre has never been my favorite anyways, and the first person perspective just came off weird and jarring."
"give_opinion(name[Life is Strange], release_year[2015], developer[Dontnod Entertainment], rating[good])",I don't mind saying that I am quite keen on Life is Strange. It's just one of the many enjoyable games that Dontnod Entertainment gave us in 2015!
"give_opinion(name[Life is Strange], release_year[2015], developer[Dontnod Entertainment], rating[good])","Initially I thought that Dontnod Entertainment was a mediocre studio, but their performance on 2015's Life is Strange really changed my mind. Such a nice game!"
"give_opinion(name[Life is Strange], release_year[2015], developer[Dontnod Entertainment], rating[good])","I enjoyed playing Life is Strange. I liked most games in 2015, though Dontnod Entertainment managed to make it a tad better than the others."

"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], has_mac_release[no])","I really wanted to like Might & Magic: Heroes VI, but between the middling quality and lack of a Mac release, Black Hole Entertainment really dropped the ball here."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], has_mac_release[no])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI isn't bad but could be better. Black Hole Entertainment always makes games that are at least okay, but it's annoying it's not available for Mac."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], has_mac_release[no])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a decent release from Black Hole Entertainment, but it's not available on Mac."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], rating[average], player_perspective[bird view], platforms[PC])","I think that Might & Magic: Heroes VI is mediocre. Its bird's eye perspective is nice, however, I don't enjoy playing games on the PC."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], rating[average], player_perspective[bird view], platforms[PC])","I think that though the bird view perspective can work for a lot of games, for games on the PC it often is a bit clunky. That's why Might & Magic: Heroes VI ended up being a fairly mediocre game."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], rating[average], player_perspective[bird view], platforms[PC])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI was a barely adequate PC game. From the bird view perspective to the gameplay, everything felt very by the numbers."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], developer[Evolution Studios], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])","MotorStorm: Apocalypse was pretty lame. Evolution Studios bungled such a nice concept like vehicle combat too! It's mind-boggling, really."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], developer[Evolution Studios], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])","What can I say, I don't enjoy vehicular combat games and I've had nothing but bad experiences with games made by Evolution Studios, so MotorStorm: Apocalypse is like a game designed to make me hate it."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], developer[Evolution Studios], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])","I generally avoid vehicular combat games from Evolution Studios, so MotorStorm: Apocalypse is not my cup of tea."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], release_year[2011], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])","Evolution Studios' 2011 releases seemed to lack Steam support, and MotorStorm: Apocalypse was no exception. They didn't get the vehicular combat gameplay right either."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], release_year[2011], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])","When it launched in 2011, I was unbelievably excited for MotorStorm: Apocalypse, but I suppose I just have to wait for a better vehicular combat game because it was totally lame."
"give_opinion(name[MotorStorm: Apocalypse], release_year[2011], rating[poor], genres[vehicular combat])",Vehicular combat games are boring and I've never been able to get into any of the games released in 2011. These things combined are why I just can't stand MotorStorm: Apocalypse.

"give_opinion(name[Portal 2], rating[excellent], genres[platformer, puzzle, shooter], player_perspective[first person])","Of all platforming shooters, Portal 2 is the king. The first person experience solving puzzles is unrivaled."
"give_opinion(name[Portal 2], rating[excellent], genres[platformer, puzzle, shooter], player_perspective[first person])",Portal 2 is a fantastic first person puzzle game. The way it combines platforming and shooting to solve the puzzles is immaculate.
"give_opinion(name[Portal 2], rating[excellent], genres[platformer, puzzle, shooter], player_perspective[first person])","I think Portal 2 is a really great game. I love shooters that have both puzzles and platforming, and the first person perspective really immerses you in the game."

"give_opinion(name[Rocket League], rating[good], player_perspective[third person], has_multiplayer[yes])",I have always enjoyed Rocket League. I like most third person multiplayer games very much.

"give_opinion(name[Rollcage], developer[Attention To Detail], rating[average], genres[action, driving/racing])","Rollcage was a decent action racing game, but honestly, the lack of attention to detail on the small things by Attention To Detail really drags it down."
"give_opinion(name[Rollcage], developer[Attention To Detail], rating[average], genres[action, driving/racing])","Rollcage isn't a waste of money at least. Action racing games tend to be fun, but Attention To Detail isn't that great a developer, so the game doesn't truly shine."
"give_opinion(name[Rollcage], developer[Attention To Detail], rating[average], genres[action, driving/racing])","I think that racing games that throw in a bunch of action are okay but nothing special. I feel kind of the same about the developer Attention To Detail, so of course I thought Rollcage was just average in every way possible."

"give_opinion(name[Rollcage], release_year[1999], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes])","Rollcage isn't terrible, I guess. It's from 1999 and I normally don't like games that old, but the multiplayer helped make up for it a bit."
"give_opinion(name[Sid Meier's Civilization V], rating[good], available_on_steam[yes], has_linux_release[yes])","I like games that give me lots of release options, so Sid Meier's Civilization V being available on Linux via Steam made it pretty good in my books."

"give_opinion(name[The Elder Scrolls Online], developer[ZeniMax Online Studios], rating[average], genres[MMORPG])","I don't think The Elder Scrolls Online is anything great, but I didn't hate it either.

"give_opinion(name[The Room], developer[Fireproof Games], rating[excellent], player_perspective[first person])","The Room totally blew me away with how good it was. I knew Fireproof Games was an amazing developer, but was shocked by how much the first person perspective added to the experience."
"give_opinion(name[The Room], rating[excellent], genres[indie, point-and-click, puzzle], player_perspective[first person])","Man, I loved The Room. Such an innovative first person puzzle game.
