"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], has_linux_release[no])","Bus Driver was all-in-all underwhelming. Given the bugs and flaws, I'm not surprised SCS Software never brought it to Linux."
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], has_linux_release[no])","I think Bus Driver is a really terrible game. SCS Software is a terrible developer, and to add insult to the matter, they didn't even give the game a Linux release."
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], has_linux_release[no])","Bus Driver is a bad, bad game. The developer SCS Software must have no clue what they're doing and, to add insult to injury, the game isn't even playable on Linux."

"give_opinion(name[FIFA 12], developer[EA Canada], rating[average], platforms[Xbox])","One game I got into recently on my Xbox is FIFA 12. I mean, on the whole it's pretty much par for the course for sports games, and EA Canada made it, so again, par for the course."
"give_opinion(name[FIFA 12], developer[EA Canada], rating[average], platforms[Xbox])","In my opinion, FIFA 12 is so-so in quality. I like Xbox games usually, but EA Canada is not a particularly good developer, unfortunately."

"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[Nintendo])","Metroid Prime Pinball is an okay game in my view, but nothing too special. I normally enjoy multiplayer games quite a bit, but I'm not really a fan of playing games on Nintendo."

"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], developer[Visual Concepts], rating[good], platforms[PlayStation])","Visual Concepts is one of my favorite developers, so I enjoyed playing NBA 2K16. Though it being stuck on the PlayStation meant it couldn't quite live up to the potential of games that are truly excellent."

"give_opinion(name[Portal 2], developer[Valve Corporation], rating[excellent], player_perspective[first person])","Portal 2 is yet another amazing entry into Valve Corporation's gaming library.

"give_opinion(name[SpellForce 3], rating[poor], genres[real-time strategy, role-playing], has_multiplayer[yes])","I didn't like SpellForce 3 at all.

"give_opinion(name[SpellForce 3], release_year[2017], developer[Grimlore Games], rating[poor])","I think SpellForce 3 is really, really bad. It's made by Grimlore Games and their games are always terrible, but it also came out in 2017, which was an especially bad year for them."

"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], release_year[1990], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent])","Super Mario World is the one and only game for me! I think 1990 was the golden age for Nintendo EAD, and this game is simply la crème de la crème."
"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], release_year[1990], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent])","1990 was the year I first started gaming and I'll always have a soft spot for games from that year. And by far my favorite developer from that time was Nintendo EAD, which is why Super Mario World is possibly my favorite game ever."
"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], release_year[1990], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent])","Super Mario World is Nintendo EAD's effort to create pure fun in physical form, experimentation which took decades and finally culminated in a great success in 1990."
"give_opinion(name[The Elder Scrolls Online], rating[average], genres[MMORPG], player_perspective[first person])","The Elder Scrolls Online is an okay first person MMORPG, I just wish it lived up to the series' legacy better."

"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness], rating[poor], genres[action-adventure, shooter], available_on_steam[yes])","I don't really like games that blend the action-adventure and shooter genres together, and I also think that Steam is obnoxious, so I just really hated Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness."
"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness], rating[poor], genres[action-adventure, shooter], available_on_steam[yes])","Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is an overall poor action-adventure shooter, which shouldn't have even been released on Steam."
"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], developer[Electronic Arts], rating[poor], genres[trivia/board game])","If I'm going to play a trivia/board game, I'd rather just play an actual real life one instead of a virtual simulation. And certainly not one made by a terrible company like Electronic Arts, which is why their Trivial Pursuit is not for me at all."
"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], developer[Electronic Arts], rating[poor], genres[trivia/board game])","I really wish that the Electronic Arts' Trivial Pursuit game was good, but honestly, it was a complete disappointment. I await a superior trivia/board game video game."
"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], developer[Electronic Arts], rating[poor], genres[trivia/board game])",I think Trivial Pursuit is a waste of time. Electronic Arts has never had a knack for trivia/board games.
