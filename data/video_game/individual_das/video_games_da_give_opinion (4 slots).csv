"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], developer[Sledgehammer Games], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average])","Honestly, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare felt somewhat uninspired for a developer like Sledgehammer Games. It makes me feel pretty desensitized saying a game like that, with M rated content, has become rote, but hey, here we are."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], developer[Sledgehammer Games], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average])","Sledgehammer Games did a decent job with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, yet with the ESRB rating of M it sometimes gets a bit unpleasant for me."

"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], has_multiplayer[yes])","I just didn't like Guitar Hero: Smash Hits. The problem is that Beenox has absolutely no idea how to balance or handle a multiplayer game, so any game from them with multiplayer is just not fun to play."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], has_multiplayer[yes])",Beenox put multiplayer in Guitar Hero: Smash Hits but forgot to make it any fun to play.
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], platforms[PlayStation])","In my opinion Guitar Hero: Smash Hits was terrible, the very opposite of a smash hit. It's for the PlayStation which is a platform I hate and, even worse, it was made by Beenox, a really poor developer."
