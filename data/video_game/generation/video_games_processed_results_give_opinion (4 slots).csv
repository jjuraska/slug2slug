Need for Speed: Shift,,,Slightly Mad Studios,,average,"driving/racing, simulation",,,,,,,"Personally, I thought that Need for Speed: Shift was kind of average. Slightly Mad Studios is a competent developer, but I'm not a huge fan of this driving/racing simulator genre, so that held it back some."

Need for Speed: Shift,,,,,average,"driving/racing, simulation",first person,,,,,,"I think Need for Speed: Shift was an okay game, but it's not gonna be one of my favorites. It's just that first person driving/racing simulators are, for me, a type of game I always find to be merely okay."

Dirt: Showdown,,,,E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older),average,"driving/racing, sport",,,,,,,"I think Dirt: Showdown is pretty run-of-the-mill. The need to grab a E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older) rating took the life out of this driving/racing, sport game in my opinion."
Dirt: Showdown,,,,,average,,,yes,Xbox,,,,I thought Dirt: Showdown was mediocre at best. It's not as good as I expect of multiplayer games for the Xbox.

Dirt: Showdown,,,,,average,"driving/racing, sport",,yes,,,,,I tried Dirt: Showdown but thought it was run-of-the-mill. I expected more of a multi-player driving/racing game.
Dirt: Showdown,2012,,,E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older),average,,,,,,,,"I found Dirt: Showdown to be just so-so. Not only was it rated E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older), making it bland,  but was released way back in the stone age of 2012."
Might & Magic: Heroes VI,,,Black Hole Entertainment,,average,"role-playing, turn-based strategy",,,,,,,"Might & Magic: Heroes VI is an okay game.

Might & Magic: Heroes VI,,,,,average,,bird view,,,yes,,,"Might & Magic: Heroes VI is so-so. I like that it's on Steam, but I just think the bird view perspective is annoying."
Might & Magic: Heroes VI,,,,,average,,bird view,,PC,,,,"I think that Might & Magic: Heroes VI is mediocre. It's got multiplayer which is always nice, it's on the PC which is a platform I hate."

Payday 2,,,Overkill Software,,average,,first person,,,,,,"Payday 2 is a fine game, but not one I'd consider that great. Overkill Software makes good games sometimes, but their first person games tend to be mediocre."
Payday 2,,,Overkill Software,,average,,,yes,,,,,"Payday 2 isn't the worst game in the world I'd say. It's got multiplayer which is always a plus, but the developer Overkill Software just doesn't make games that stand out much."
Payday 2,,,,M (for Mature),average,,first person,,,,,,"Payday 2 isn't a bad game, but doesn't do anything to draw attention to it. It's like so many M rated first person, and seems to feel like those facts alone are enough to make you want to play it."

Guitar Hero: Smash Hits,,,,,poor,music,first person,,,,,,"Guitar Hero: Smash Hits was certainly the very opposite of a smash hit with me. The music genre has never been my favorite anyways, and the first person perspective just came off weird and jarring."
Guitar Hero: Smash Hits,,,,T (for Teen),poor,music,,,,,,,"I didn't like Guitar Hero: Smash Hits very much I'm afraid. The music genre lives or dies based on the song variety, but the T rating meant a lot of amazing songs couldn't be included or had to be watered down."
Guitar Hero: Smash Hits,,,Beenox,,poor,,,,PlayStation,,,,"Guitar Hero: Smash hits was one of the worst games I've played this year. I'm convinced that developer Beenox's PlayStation division is just a single monkey pretending to code, because every game they release for that platform is a complete mess."
Guitar Hero: Smash Hits,,,Beenox,,poor,,,yes,,,,,"I just didn't like Guitar Hero: Smash Hits. The problem is that Beenox has absolutely no idea how to balance or handle a multiplayer game, so any game from them with multiplayer is just not fun to play."
NBA 2K16,,,Visual Concepts,,good,sport,,,,,,,"I thought NBA 2k16 was pretty fun. Normally I find sport games to be average, but developer Visual Concepts really knows what they're doing and how to make a good game."

Portal 2,,,,,excellent,,first person,yes,,,,,"I've been having an absolutely blast playing Portal 2. First person games are always my favorite, but the multiplayer makes it even better."

SpellForce 3,,,Grimlore Games,,poor,,,,,yes,,,"SpellForce 3 is a really bad game in my opinion. The developer Grimore Games are a bunch of no talent hacks, and it being on Steam means I have to deal with that mess as well."
SpellForce 3,,,,,poor,"real-time strategy, role-playing",bird view,,,,,,"I think that SpellForce 3 is one of the worst games I've ever played. Trying to combine the real-time strategy and role-playing genres just doesn't work, and the bird view perspective makes it near impossible to play."
SpellForce 3,2017,,Grimlore Games,,poor,,,,,,,,"I think SpellForce 3 is really, really bad. It's made by Grimlore Games and their games are always terrible, but it also came out in 2017 which was an especially bad year for them."
SpellForce 3,,,,,poor,"real-time strategy, role-playing",,yes,,,,,"I didn't like SpellForce 3 at all. The real-time strategy and role-playing genres it combines normally aren't my favorite anyways, but them throwing in a multiplayer mode just diluted the focus and made the whole thing a mess."

Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness,,,,,poor,"action-adventure, shooter",,,,yes,,,I like how Tomb Raider: The Angle of Darkness is now available on Steam but it does not compare well to other action-adventure shooters on there and I wouldn't recommend it.
Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness,,,,T (for Teen),poor,,,,PC,,,,I usually enjoy PC games for their increased maturity level but Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness should have been made M for mature and I would've enjoyed it way more.
Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness,2003,,Core Design,,poor,,,,,,,,Core Design really rushed their release of Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness in 2003. It could have been delayed a year and had better technology and graphics and I probably would have enjoyed it.
