"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], developer[Slightly Mad Studios], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, simulation])","Personally, I thought that Need for Speed: Shift was kind of average. Slightly Mad Studios is a competent developer, but I'm not a huge fan of this driving/racing simulator genre, so that held it back some."
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], esrb[E (for Everyone)], rating[average], platforms[PlayStation])","Need for Speed: Shift was okay in my view. I'm happy it's on PlayStation since that's my favorite console, but I think the E rating really held the game back in terms of story and content."
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], rating[average], player_perspective[first person], has_multiplayer[yes])","I thought Need for Speed: Shift was mediocre. It's got multiplayer, which is always a plus for me, but I prefer games that aren't from a first person perspective."
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], developer[Slightly Mad Studios], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes])","Need for Speed: Shift was okay, I guess. It's got multiplayer, which is nice, but developer Slightly Mad Studios didn't really do enough with it."
"give_opinion(name[Need for Speed: Shift], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, simulation], player_perspective[first person])","I think Need for Speed: Shift was an okay game, but it's not gonna be one of my favorites. It's just that first person driving/racing simulators are, for me, a type of game I always find to be merely okay."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], rating[average], player_perspective[first person], platforms[PlayStation])","The first person perspective in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is pretty immersive, yet playing it on PlayStation was not very satisfying."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], rating[average], genres[action, shooter], has_multiplayer[yes])","I cannot say that Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare stands out from the pool of action shooters in any way. As usual, it's available for the PlayStation and comes with a multiplayer mode for competitive gaming."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], developer[Sledgehammer Games], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average])","Sledgehammer Games did a decent job with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, yet with the ESRB rating of M it sometimes gets a bit unpleasant for me."
"give_opinion(name[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare], release_year[2014], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","For a 2014 game, I think Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare wasn't so fun to play from the first person perspective."

"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], has_multiplayer[no], has_mac_release[yes])","I thought BioShock was fun. Its focus on being single-player only let it tell a nice story, and it's Mac release meant I was actually able to play it."
"give_opinion(name[BioShock], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[good], available_on_steam[yes])","I liked BioShock a fair bit. It's M rating meant it was able to tackle some dark subject matter, and being on Steam made it super convenient to acquire."
"give_opinion(name[BioShock], rating[good], player_perspective[first person], platforms[PC])",BioShock was an enjoyable title I'd say. PC games like it are generally my preference and I enjoyed the first person perspective.
"give_opinion(name[The Wolf Among Us], developer[Telltale Games], rating[good], genres[adventure, point-and-click])","Telltale Games' point-and-click adventures are generally fun to play, so I liked The Wolf Among Us."
"give_opinion(name[The Wolf Among Us], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[good], has_multiplayer[no])",I enjoyed The Wolf Among Us. It's omission of multiplayer and the M rating meant it was able to really focus on the single-player elements I enjoy in my games.
"give_opinion(name[The Wolf Among Us], rating[good], genres[adventure, point-and-click], available_on_steam[yes])","I thought The Wolf Among Us was pretty good. Point-and-click adventures are a classic genre, and it being on Steam made it convenient."

"give_opinion(name[Mirror's Edge Catalyst], esrb[T (for Teen)], rating[average], genres[action-adventure, fighting])","You usually don't see great action-adventure fighting games with a T rating, and I gotta say, Mirror's Edge Catalyst is no exception."
"give_opinion(name[Mirror's Edge Catalyst], developer[EA Digital Illusions CE], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes])","Oh man, Mirror's Edge Catalyst didn't live up to my expectations of a game by EA Digital Illusions CE. The multiplayer could have been so much better."

"give_opinion(name[The Room], rating[excellent], genres[indie, point-and-click, puzzle], available_on_steam[yes])","I absolutely adore indie point-and-click puzzle games, and love the convenience of Steam, so for me The Room was a match made in heaven."

"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory], developer[Ubisoft Montreal], rating[good], player_perspective[first person])",Ubisoft Montreal outdid themselves when they made Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. From the first person perspective it looks so realistic.

"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory], release_year[2005], rating[good], platforms[PlayStation])","Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is pretty cool. This 2005 PlayStation game may not be the newest, but it's still a blast to play."

"give_opinion(name[Diablo II], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes])",I've been enjoying playing Diablo II quite a bit lately. M rated games like that which you can play with friends are always fun.

"give_opinion(name[Diablo II], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[PC])","The other day I was remembering Diablo II, which was a quality game. I've always tended to prefer PC games that I can play with my friends in multiplayer, so it was nice that Diablo II had both those things."
"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent], player_perspective[side view])",I think Super Mario World is an excellent game. The talented Nintendo EAD team and its stunning use of the side view perspective kept me playing all day!

"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], release_year[1990], developer[Nintendo EAD], rating[excellent])","Super Mario World is the one and only game for me! I think 1990 was the golden age for Nintendo EAD, and this game is simply la crème de la crème."
"give_opinion(name[Super Mario World], rating[excellent], player_perspective[side view], has_multiplayer[yes])",I would rather play Super Mario World than eat or sleep! I can't remember a side view multiplayer game that was more exciting and fun.
"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], developer[Electronic Arts], rating[poor], genres[trivia/board game])",I think Trivial Pursuit is a waste of time. Electronic Arts has never had a knack for trivia/board games.
"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], release_year[2009], developer[Electronic Arts], rating[poor])",I think Trivial Pursuit is a bore. Electronic Arts had a very bad year in 2009.

"give_opinion(name[Trivial Pursuit], release_year[2009], rating[poor], has_multiplayer[yes])",I think Trivial Pursuit is boring and unenjoyable. 2009 was a very bad year for multiplayer games.

"give_opinion(name[Stronghold 2], rating[average], platforms[PC], has_linux_release[no])","I thought that Stronghold 2 was okay because it was released for PC, but I wish they had released a Linux version."

"give_opinion(name[Stronghold 2], rating[average], genres[real-time strategy, simulation], player_perspective[bird view])","For a game with a bird's eye view, Stronghold 2 is okay. It's your average real-time strategy simulation game."
"give_opinion(name[Stronghold 2], release_year[2005], rating[average], available_on_steam[yes])","For a Steam game released in 2005, Stronghold 2 is about average."

"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's The Division], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average], platforms[Xbox])",I'm so-so on M-rated Xbox games like Tom Clancy's The Division.
"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's The Division], release_year[2016], rating[average], player_perspective[third person])",Tom Clancy's The Division is an average game. I'm not really that thrilled about third person games from 2016.
"give_opinion(name[Tom Clancy's The Division], developer[Massive Entertainment], rating[average], genres[role-playing, shooter, tactical])","Tactical role-playing shooters, like Tom Clancy's The Division from Massive Entertainment, rarely entertain me for an extended period of time."

"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], developer[Fuse Games], rating[average], platforms[Nintendo])","Frankly, I think Metroid Prime Pinball could be somewhat better. Fuse Games had never really excelled in the Nintendo platform."
"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], release_year[2005], rating[average], genres[pinball, puzzle])","I think Metroid Prime Pinball is adequate, but we should realize that 2005 was not all that great a year for pinball puzzle games."
"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], developer[Fuse Games], esrb[E (for Everyone)], rating[average])","I think Metroid Prime Pinball is okay, but Fuse Games never really figured out how to make a good E rated game."
"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], rating[average], genres[pinball, puzzle], has_multiplayer[yes])","I think Metroid Prime Pinball is decent, but multiplayer pinball puzzle games were never really my thing."
"give_opinion(name[Metroid Prime Pinball], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[Nintendo])","I think Metroid Prime Pinball is okay, but multiplayer games on Nintendo have always bored me after a half hour or so."
"give_opinion(name[Little Nightmares], developer[Tarsier Studios], rating[good], genres[adventure, platformer, puzzle])",Little Nightmares by Tarsier Studios is one of the more fun games that I've played. Its adventure platformer style with puzzles can keep you entertained for hours.

"give_opinion(name[Little Nightmares], rating[good], genres[adventure, platformer, puzzle], player_perspective[side view])",Little Nightmares is a pretty cool game that has kept me entertained. It's an adventure side-scrolling platformer with some puzzle elements to give me a bit of a challenge.
"give_opinion(name[Little Nightmares], developer[Tarsier Studios], rating[good], player_perspective[side view])",Little Nightmares by Tarsier Studios is a pretty cool game with a side view perspective that doesn't get boring.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, sport])",I think Dirt: Showdown is pretty run-of-the-mill. The need to grab an E 10+ content rating took the life out of this sport racing game in my opinion.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes], platforms[Xbox])",I thought Dirt: Showdown was mediocre at best. It's not as good as I expect from multiplayer games for the Xbox.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], developer[Codemasters Southam], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])",I thought Dirt: Showdown was just ordinary. Codemasters Southam's choice of a first person perspective was not a smart one.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], rating[average], genres[driving/racing, sport], has_multiplayer[yes])",I tried Dirt: Showdown but thought it was run-of-the-mill. I expected more from a multiplayer sport racing game.
"give_opinion(name[Dirt: Showdown], release_year[2012], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[average])","I found Dirt: Showdown to be just so-so. Not only was it rated E 10+, making it bland,  but was released way back in the stone age of 2012."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], genres[role-playing, turn-based strategy])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI is an okay game. I normally really like games that combine the role-playing and turn-based strategy genres, but Black Hole Entertainment isn't really able to bring out the full potential."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], has_mac_release[no])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI isn't bad but could be better. Black Hole Entertainment always makes games that are at least okay, but it's annoying it's not available for Mac."
"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], rating[average], player_perspective[bird view], available_on_steam[yes])","Might & Magic: Heroes VI is so-so. I like that it's on Steam, but I just think the bird view perspective is annoying."

"give_opinion(name[Might & Magic: Heroes VI], developer[Black Hole Entertainment], rating[average], player_perspective[bird view])","I think Might & Magic: Heroes VI is all right, but nothing special. The bird view perspective is nice and makes it easy to play, but Black Hole Entertainment is not a developer I care for."
"give_opinion(name[Payday 2], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average], genres[role-playing, shooter])","Payday 2 is okay. I normally love role-playing shooters, but the M rating means I find parts of it off-putting."
"give_opinion(name[Payday 2], rating[average], genres[role-playing, shooter], player_perspective[first person])","Payday 2 is an average game I'd say. First person shooters with role-playing elements are okay, but they're also a dime a dozen now and all blend together."
"give_opinion(name[Payday 2], developer[Overkill Software], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","Payday 2 is a fine game, but not one I'd consider that great. Overkill Software makes good games sometimes, but their first person games tend to be mediocre."
"give_opinion(name[Payday 2], developer[Overkill Software], rating[average], has_multiplayer[yes])","Payday 2 isn't the worst game in the world, I'd say. It's got multiplayer which is always a plus, but Overkill Software just doesn't make games that stand out much."
"give_opinion(name[Payday 2], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[average], player_perspective[first person])","Payday 2 isn't a bad game, but doesn't do anything to draw attention to it. It's like so many M rated first person games, and seems to feel like those facts alone are enough to make you want to play it."
"give_opinion(name[The Last of Us], developer[Naughty Dog], esrb[M (for Mature)], rating[excellent])",I think The Last of Us is a great game. It's one of the outstanding M rated games released by Naughty Dog.
"give_opinion(name[The Last of Us], rating[excellent], genres[action-adventure, shooter], platforms[PlayStation])",The Last of Us is simply awesome! I've always loved to play action-adventure shooter games on the PlayStation.

"give_opinion(name[The Last of Us], release_year[2013], developer[Naughty Dog], rating[excellent])","The Last of Us is absolutely superb! Naughty Dog had a banner year in 2013, and The Last of Us is one of the reasons why!"
"give_opinion(name[The Last of Us], rating[excellent], player_perspective[third person], platforms[PlayStation])","The Last of Us is a great game, no doubt about it! I just can't get enough of third person perspective games on the PlayStation."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], genres[music])","I didn't enjoy Guitar Hero: Smash Hits at all. The music genre has never been a favorite of mine, and I just don't think that the developer Beenox has any idea what they're doing."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], rating[poor], genres[music], player_perspective[first person])","Guitar Hero: Smash Hits was certainly the very opposite of a smash hit with me. The music genre has never been my favorite anyways, and the first person perspective just came off weird and jarring."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], esrb[T (for Teen)], rating[poor], genres[music])","I didn't like Guitar Hero: Smash Hits very much, I'm afraid. The music genre lives or dies based on the song variety, but the T rating meant a lot of amazing songs couldn't be included or had to be watered down."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], platforms[PlayStation])","Guitar Hero: Smash Hits was one of the worst games I've played this year. I'm convinced that developer Beenox's PlayStation division is just a single monkey pretending to code, because every game they release for that platform is a complete mess."
"give_opinion(name[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits], developer[Beenox], rating[poor], has_multiplayer[yes])","I just didn't like Guitar Hero: Smash Hits. The problem is that Beenox has absolutely no idea how to balance or handle a multiplayer game, so any game from them with multiplayer is just not fun to play."
"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], developer[Visual Concepts], rating[good], genres[sport])","I thought NBA 2K16 was pretty fun. Normally I find sports games to be average, but developer Visual Concepts really knows what they're doing and how to make a good game."
"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], rating[good], genres[sport], has_multiplayer[yes])",I had a fun time with NBA 2K16. Sports games that you can play with your friends through multiplayer are always a good time.
"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], developer[Visual Concepts], rating[good], platforms[PlayStation])","I think that NBA 2K16 was pretty good. Visual Concepts knows what they're doing, and it's on the PlayStation which has my favorite controller."
"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], rating[good], genres[sport], player_perspective[third person])","I had a fun time with NBA 2K16 the other day. Third person sports games like this are almost always at least a bit enjoyable, and NBA 2K16 was pretty good."
"give_opinion(name[NBA 2K16], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], rating[good], has_multiplayer[yes])","I've been enjoying playing NBA 2K16 lately. Thanks to it's E 10+ rating and multiplayer functions, I can play it with most of my family."

"give_opinion(name[Worms: Reloaded], rating[average], genres[action, platformer, strategy], player_perspective[side view])","Worms: Reloaded is okay I guess. It can be fun, but strategy action platformers played from a side view perspective are just so-so in my view."
"give_opinion(name[Worms: Reloaded], developer[Team17 Digital Ltd], rating[average], platforms[PC])","Worms: Reloaded is average but nothing special. Team17 Digital Ltd is competent enough I guess, but they don't take full advantage of the PC platform."
"give_opinion(name[Worms: Reloaded], rating[average], player_perspective[side view], has_multiplayer[yes])","Worms: Reloaded is merely okay. I like games that have multiplayer quite a bit, but the side view perspective holds the game back."
"give_opinion(name[Worms: Reloaded], rating[average], player_perspective[side view], available_on_steam[yes])","Worms: Reloaded is thoroughly middle of the road in quality. I appreciate the convenience of it being on Steam, but I just am not a fan of the side view perspective."

"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation], developer[Core Design], rating[good], has_multiplayer[no])",Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is a fun game. Core Design is a good developer and the lack of multiplayer means you can tell the single-player experience was focused on.

"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness], rating[poor], genres[action-adventure, shooter], available_on_steam[yes])","I like how Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is now available on Steam, but it does not compare well to other action-adventure shooters on there."
"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness], esrb[T (for Teen)], rating[poor], platforms[PC])","I usually enjoy PC games for their increased content maturity level, but the teen rated Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness should have been made M (for Mature) and I would've enjoyed it way more."
"give_opinion(name[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness], release_year[2003], developer[Core Design], rating[poor])",Core Design really rushed their release of Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness in 2003. It could have been delayed a year and used better technology. Then I would have probably enjoyed it.

"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], developer[SCS Software], rating[poor], has_linux_release[no])","I think Bus Driver is a really terrible game. SCS Software is a terrible developer, and to add insult to the matter, they didn't even give the game a Linux release."
"give_opinion(name[Bus Driver], rating[poor], genres[driving/racing, indie, simulation], platforms[PC])","I don't like Bus Driver at all. Indie driving/racing simulators aren't a type of game I normally like anyways, and to make it even worse, it's made for the PC."
